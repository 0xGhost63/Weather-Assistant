## Flask Weather App

This is a simple and minimal weather-based web application built using Flask.  
The project uses Bootstrap for basic styling, Jinja2 for templating, and standard HTML/CSS along with core Python concepts.

The application fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API and dynamically displays city-related background images using the Pixabay API.
